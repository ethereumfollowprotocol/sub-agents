# LLM Agent Development Specification

## Overview

This specification defines an organizational framework for Large Language Model (LLM) agent development that improves results through clear expectations, boundaries, and structured processes. The framework emphasizes immersive context creation, role separation, and iterative development cycles.

## Core Principles

### 1. Immersive Context Creation
Agents should create rich, detailed contexts that provide comprehensive understanding. Immersion is achieved through:
- **Shared Context**: All agents must maintain consistent understanding of the project state
- **Descriptive Language**: Use clear, vivid descriptions that establish context and expectations
- **Narrative Continuity**: Each interaction should build upon previous context

**Example**: Instead of "Fix the login bug," use "The authentication gateway is failing to properly validate user credentials, causing users to be locked out of their accounts. The validation mechanism appears to have degraded, possibly due to recent infrastructure changes. Investigate the credential validation process and restore proper system access."

### 2. Separation of Responsibilities
Agents are organized into distinct roles with specific responsibilities:

#### Goal Evaluation Agents
- **Purpose**: Assess high-level objectives and strategic direction
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Analyze project goals for clarity and achievability
  - Identify potential conflicts or dependencies
  - Provide strategic recommendations
- **Context**: Strategic oversight role - maintains holistic view of organizational objectives

#### Task Generation Agents  
- **Purpose**: Transform goals into actionable tasks
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Create detailed Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)
  - Break down complex objectives into executable steps
  - Define success criteria and acceptance conditions
- **Context**: Requirements architect - transforms high-level goals into detailed implementation plans

#### Task Evaluation Agents
- **Purpose**: Assess individual task quality and completeness
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Review task specifications for clarity
  - Validate task feasibility and resource requirements
  - Ensure tasks align with broader goals
- **Context**: Quality assurance role - validates specifications meet standards and requirements

#### Execution Agents
- **Purpose**: Implement tasks and deliver results
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Execute assigned tasks according to specifications
  - Report progress and blockers
  - Deliver measurable outcomes
- **Context**: Implementation specialists - execute tasks according to specifications

## Development Cycle

The development process follows a structured cycle designed to maintain quality and alignment:

## Task Tracking System

### Repository-Level Task Management
Each repository implementing this specification must maintain a comprehensive task history using a standardized tracking system located in the repository root.

#### Directory Structure
```
.tasks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TASK-001.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TASK-002.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TASK-003.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

#### Task File Naming Convention
- **Format**: `TASK-###.md` where `###` is a zero-padded, incrementing counter
- **Counter**: Starts at 001 and increments for each new task in the repository
- **Scope**: Counter is repository-specific, not global across projects

#### Task File Structure
Each task file must contain the following sections:

```markdown
# TASK-### - [Task Title]

## Metadata
- **Created**: [ISO 8601 timestamp]
- **Status**: [pending|in_progress|completed|cancelled]
- **Agent**: [Agent type that handled this task]
